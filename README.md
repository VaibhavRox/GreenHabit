## Problem Statement Addressed
In shared environments like college campuses, hygiene and cleanliness are everyone's responsibilityâ€”but often no one's priority. Students and staff frequently neglect basic habits such as handwashing, proper waste disposal, and maintaining shared spaces like toilets, desks, or kitchens. Overflowing bins, unreported messes, and blame-shifting to cleaning staff are common, largely due to the absence of a transparent, engaging system to monitor, encourage, and reward these daily hygiene actions. This lack of personal accountability and motivation results in an unclean, unhealthy environment that affects well-being and sustainability efforts.

## Project Overview
### What It Does:

CleanCampus is a gamified hygiene and cleanliness tracking app designed to improve campus sanitation through daily habit logging, real-world actions, and friendly competition. It rewards users for hygiene tasks (e.g., handwashing, desk cleaning, waste disposal), verified trash snaps, and shared-space cleanliness reports. Points contribute to leaderboards at both individual and room levels, unlocking real-world rewards or donation opportunities.

### How It Works:

Users earn XP by logging hygiene actions, uploading trash disposal photos (Trash Snap), and reporting unclean shared areas.
Weekly quests and daily streak bonuses increase engagement, while machine-vision verifies image submissions.
Admins manage scoring rules, review reports, and monitor cleanliness trends via a dedicated web portal.
Leaderboards and badges promote ongoing participation and social accountability among students and staff.

### Who It Benefits:

Students & Staff: Builds lasting hygiene habits, creates team spirit through group challenges, and offers meaningful incentives like cafÃ© credits or sustainability donations.
Campus Management: Gains visibility into hygiene behaviors, reduces complaints, and fosters a cleaner, healthier learning environment.
Environment: Encourages sustainable practices like recycling and litter prevention, supported by research showing up to 50% improvements in behavior with gamified systems.
